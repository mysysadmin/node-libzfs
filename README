node-libzfs

node-libzfs is a Node.js addon that interfaces to libzfs allowing node programs to
read zpool/zfs properties.

Status

Currently it only allows read-only mode.
It still needs some love in order to provide
more features.

Platform

This should work on Solaris and derivatives, maybe FreeBSD.

Installation/Configuration

% node-waf configure
% node-waf build

API

Work is in progress.

EXAMPLES

Try it with ./test.js
It is similar to "zpool list"

Work is in progress.
